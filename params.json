  "body": "ModernHttpClient\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis library brings the latest platform-specific networking libraries to\r\nXamarin applications via a custom HttpClient handler. Write your app using\r\nSystem.Net.Http, but drop this library in and it will go drastically faster.\r\nThis is made possible by two native libraries:\r\n\r\n* On iOS, [NSURLSession](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSession_class/Introduction/Introduction.html)\r\n* On Android, via [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe good news is, you don't have to know either of these two libraries above,\r\nusing ModernHttpClient is the most boring thing in the world. Here's how\r\nit works:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar httpClient = new HttpClient(new NativeMessageHandler());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How can I use this in a PCL?\r\n\r\nJust reference the Portable version of ModernHttpClient in your Portable\r\nLibrary, and it will use the correct version on all platforms.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why doesn't this build in Xamarin Studio? What gives?\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n## Run this first\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n",
